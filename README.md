# ML---Clustering-Unknown-Facial-Data-Action-Units-

## Data Clustering of Unknown Images

## Techniques used : 

Dimensionality Reduction from 27 to 2 (Principal Component Analysis)

The optimal Score for Silhoutte in KMeans clustering was best for the case where there are 2 clusters encompassing all data points. The corresponding silhoutte score was 0.52

Optimal Value : 2

This signifies that in multiple cluster divisions of different sizes, dividing the dataset in only 2 parts achieves the best homogeneity amongst the clusters i.e. these clusters have points that are very similar to each other compared to the other cluster.
